                        I have grown up and interacted with technology constantly and with the addition of watching my dad build PCs, it has sparked my fascination with computers. My first real experience with coding began in secondary school starting with visual basic as my first language. My interest only grew as I began to discover how the games I play and applications I use are all coded and how real world problems can be solved by code.

                        In my spare time, I often create Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS programs and practice using GitHub to track the progress of my code and to familiarise myself with working in a group development environment. Recently in University, I have learnt the Java programming language alongside Object Oriented programming and it has rapidly become my favourite language to code in.

                    Favourite coding experience

                        One of my favorite coding experiences was during my A-level Computer Science course in sixth form. I created a Driving Test Theory app using Python and the tkinter library for the GUI. Despite facing challenges, I completed the project, which was a culmination of my programming knowledge. I even added features like a local flat-file database for user registration, used graphs for result visualization, and experimented with Object-Oriented Programming. Although the 3300-line Python program wasn't my cleanest or most efficient, it marked a significant step in my journey toward becoming a Software Engineer. You can watch a video of the app here: [link].

                        Another notable coding achievement was when I designed a two-player blackjack game in Java for my Programming 1 course, adhering to object-oriented principles and ensuring clean code and a user-friendly text interface. I was thrilled with the final product.
